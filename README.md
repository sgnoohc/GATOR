## Running on HiPerGator

### Instructions

Login to hpg
```
ssh $user@hpg.rc.ufl.edu
```

On login[1-6] node checkout the code
```
git clone git@github.com:sgnoohc/GATOR.git
```

Then fire up an interactive (option -i) SLURM job. (SLURM is an alternative to Condor)
Following command requests one A100 GPU node.
```
srun --partition=gpu --gpus=1 --mem=16gb --constraint=a100 --pty bash -i
```

Or, if you are just testing the code, use an interactive job on a CPU node instead:
```
srun --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --mem=2gb -t 90 --pty bash -i
```

Within the node:
```
cd GATOR/gnn
source setup_hpg.sh
python python/ingress.py configs/ChangGNN_MDnodes_LSedges.json
python python/train.py configs/ChangGNN_MDnodes_LSedges.json
python python/infer.py configs/ChangGNN_MDnodes_LSedges.json
python scripts/plot.py configs/ChangGNN_MDnodes_LSedges.json
```

More detailed instructions can be found in the README in `GATOR/gnn`.

This creates the `output.root` that contains the MD and LS with `LS_score` branch

While the job is running, you can get the job ID from the output of `squeue -u $USER`. 
With this ID, you can find get metrics for your job, e.g. the GPU usage via `nvida-smi` for job `123456`:
```
srun --jobid=123456 nvidia-smi
```

### Input

The beginning input `LSTNtuple.root` is located in Philip's home area.
The intermediate values are also in the home area.
In the python scripts in various places, the respective intermediate results outputs are located in the path noted in the comment. 

### Displaying via plotly

We will use https://jhub.rc.ufl.edu

In the terminal install plotly/uproot/uproot-awkward
```
module load python/3.10
pip install plotly
pip install uproot
pip install awkward-pandas
```

Then go to `display/` and open `EventDisplay.ipynb` for examples
